nama
==============================

Using deep learning to find similar personal names

## Initial Setup
    make create_environment
    conda activate nama
    make requirements
    make sync_data_from_s3
    nbstripout --install    # automatically strip notebook output before commit

## Using Fastec2
* Instructions: https://www.fast.ai/2019/02/15/fastec2/
* pip install git+https://github.com/fastai/fastec2.git
* fe2 launch <name> base 80 r5.2xlarge  # 80Gb disk, 64Gb memory
* ./remote-install.sh <ip>
* fe2 connect <name> 8888
  * conda activate nama
  * jupyter notebook
* fe2 stop <name>  # stopped instances can be re-started with fe2 start <name>
* fe2 terminate <name> # releases instance name and associated disk

## Data locations
* raw data can be found at s3://familysearch-names/raw 
* large interim data files can be found at s3://familysearch-names/interim
* data files in /data can be downloaded from s3://nama-data using `make sync_data_from_s3`
* new data files in /data can be uploaded to s3://nama-data using `make sync_data_to_s3`

## Data description
* tree_hr_given-similar.csv + tree-hr-surname-similar.csv - likely-similar name pairs
  * name - preferred name in the tree
  *	alt_name - name in the record (pairs are omitted when alt_name is the same as name)
  * frequency - how many times these two names appear together
  *	reverse_frequency - how many times the alt_name is the name in the tree and the name is the name in the record
  *	sum_name_frequency - how many times the (tree) name appears as a (tree) name
  *	total_name_frequency - how many times the (tree) name appears as a (tree) name or as an alt_name
  *	total_alt_name_frequency - how many times the alt_name appears as an alt_name or a (tree) name
  *	ordered_prob - frequency / sum_name_frequency
  *	unordered_prob - (frequency + reverse_frequency) / the total number of times either name appears as a name or an alt_name
  *	similarity - 1.0 - (levenshtein distance between the name and alt_name / max(len(name), len)alt_name)))
